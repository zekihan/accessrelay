# Publishing

Ordinary pull requests run native checks and builds. Container smoke checks and
release cross-compilation run only before publication, on the captured source commit.

The Publish workflow runs nightly or manually on `main` to update multi-architecture
`edge` in GHCR and Docker Hub. Pushes to `main` do not publish. Unchanged successful
inputs are skipped. After a failure, fix the source or explicitly rerun the failed
jobs; the same failed revision is not retried automatically. Manual force rebuilds
unchanged edge inputs and never replaces a stable version.

Stable releases start from an existing signed `vX.Y.Z` tag whose commit belongs to
main and whose version matches `VERSION`. Prepare the version locally, update any
version adapters, run checks, commit and sign the tag. Push only when ready:

```sh
git push --atomic origin main vX.Y.Z
```

Keep `charts/accessrelay/Chart.yaml` version and appVersion equal to `VERSION`.
Charts publish to OCI only with stable releases and default to that release image.
A chart change needs a new release; homelab may override the image with `edge@sha256`.

A tag builds fresh artifacts, publishes immutable `X.Y.Z` images to both registries,
verifies them, moves `latest` forward and creates the GitHub release last. An identical
existing version is a no-op; different content fails. Fix a bad release with a new
patch version. Old published tags remain available.

Publishing uses full-SHA pins to `zekihan/release-workflows`. Review pin updates;
the shared workflow embeds its helpers rather than fetching executable scripts from
a moving branch. Repo-specific build commands run without publication credentials.

Both registries must be configured before first publication. Image packages and
release charts must permit anonymous pulls; publication verifies that access.

Registry updates are not atomic. If publication stops partway, use **Re-run failed
jobs** within seven days to reuse the prepared artifacts. Re-running every job can
produce different bytes and correctly fail the immutability check. Never retag or
overwrite an existing release to recover. After artifact expiry, use a new version
if the original content cannot be recovered.
