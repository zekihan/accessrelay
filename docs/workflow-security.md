# Workflow supply-chain policy (OPS-43)

All direct external actions, including read-only checks, use immutable full commit
SHAs. Version comments identify the intended release. On 2026-10-27 the pins below
were resolved from the official GitHub repository tag API, peeling annotated tags
to commits; action manifests at those commits were inspected (Node 24 runtimes).
This validates release identity, not an assertion that upstream code is bug-free.

The reusable PR workflow runs the policy and synthetic regression tests before
publication gates can pass. Checkout credential persistence is disabled everywhere.
Workflow-level tokens are read-only; publication write scopes are job-local.
Registry passwords remain on the precise login/description step that needs them.
Renovate must propose full-SHA updates for review with release comments; automerge
is disabled for action updates. Review the upstream release and commit diff before
accepting a new hash. Do not weaken checks when private Actions minutes run out.

Run locally:

```sh
python3 -m venv /tmp/workflow-policy-venv
/tmp/workflow-policy-venv/bin/pip install -r tests/workflows/requirements.txt
/tmp/workflow-policy-venv/bin/python scripts/check_workflows.py
/tmp/workflow-policy-venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests/workflows
```

## Local validation

Passed: actionlint for every workflow; policy plus 11 regression tests; `make
lint test test/race test/integration chart-package release-check` (using the
temporary Python venv for chart tests); and `make container-test` against local
Docker Desktop with disposable fixtures. No publishing workflow was run.
